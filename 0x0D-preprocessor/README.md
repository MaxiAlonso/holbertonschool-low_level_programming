# **0x0D. C – Preprocessor**

The learning objectives for this project were:

## **General**

	• What are macros and how to use them
	• What are the most common predefined macros
	• How to include guard your header files

For this project we had to create the following header files and C programs:

	• 0-object_like_macro.h - define a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
	• 1-pi.h - define a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.
	• 2-main.c - prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.
	• 3-function_like_macro.h - function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.
	• 4-sum.h - function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
