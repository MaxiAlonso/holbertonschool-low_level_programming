# **0x09 static libraries**

The learning objectives for this project were:

## **General**
	• What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
	• Basic usage of ar, ranlib, nm

For this project we had two tasks, the first one was creating a static library and the second one creating a script that creates a static library from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
